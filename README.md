## Setting up your server

Once you've created a Glitch (https://glitch.com) project using the template, follow these steps:

In the server's `config.json`:
1. Find the `host` property.
2. Replace "`aps-template`" with your glitch project's name, it should be in the top-left corner above "Settings".

Then, give your new project a name. (Settings > Edit project details)

Your private server will be at <https://servername.glitch.me> (replace `servername` with its new name, it should be in the top-left corner above "Settings")
